New York was supposed to be just a one year sabbatical, then I fell in love - with the city, the people, the industry.

        "fulldescription3": "When I lived in Seattle, I volunteered at my church kitchen every Thursday and Friday. There were days I was coming in from extremely stressful work days. Being in the kitchen with fellow volunteers, making and distributing meals for our community always uplifted me and put things in perspective for me. Realizing that \"stressful work days\" and the issues I thought were stressful were truly miniscule on the grand scheme of things... that there was such a large part of our community that were experiencing food insecurity and not having a place to call home - those were real problems.",

        "fulldescription4": "Growing up my family struggled with poverty and food insecurity. I have fond memories of restaurants, organizations and small businesses that always extended their support, love and care to my family. As a child, I was grateful, but didn't understand the gravity of it, as I do now. I am still grateful and those hold those memories very dear to my heart. It is so important to me that I make sure that what ever it is I do, I am able to provide a place that is warm and community oriented. You never know what kind of impact you can make to a person or family, but you can start by creating a place that is welcoming to all.",
